  # Description
  This app allows the user to create an HTMl page displaying a team of employees and displaying their contact information. We use node.js in order to run the command line. The user will then be able to test the files of each employee and see if they pass. 

  # Installation
  In order to run the application you must first install npm modukles by typing `npm install` in the terminal. After you will be able to run the `npm test` so see if each file passes. Then finally run a node on one of the employees by typing `node index.js in the terminal to commense the prompts of questions.
